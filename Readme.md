**Directions**
This code is meant to be run in unity, it only uses it to store and edit the object posisitions on the scene and nothing else
to run the code do the following

1: move all the scripts into your assets folder in a unity 3d project
2: apply the rayTracerScript.cs script to the your camera
3: apply the rayTracerShader.shader script to the Ray Tracing Shader input on the rayTracerScript in your camera
4: add spheres to the scene
5: add the colorSetterScript.cs to the spheres so you can edit their materials
6: add colors to the spheres, and most importantly add at least one sphere with black color, white emission color, and some emission strength (2 is fairly strong)
7: click run and make sure the use shader in scene view is toggled on your camera otherwise it just looks normal
